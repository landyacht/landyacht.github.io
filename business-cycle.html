			<h1> Why Does the Economy Fluctuate?, or a Synopsis of Austrian Business Cycle Theory </h1>

			<p>
				In this article I will outline why economies have boom-bust cycles and what exacerbates these cycles.
				Very little of this is original thought—it's merely a retelling of what I have learned, in a concise, written form.
				I hope it will be a useful text for those who are curious and want a single-article synopsis.
				Mind you, this is still a fairly long and dense read, so I hope you're interested in the topic.
			</p>
			<p>
				If you're familiar with economics, you may know this theory as the Austrian Business Cycle Theory, after the Austrian School of economics.
				The term Austrian is a result of the nationality of those who began the school, including Eugen Böhm-Bawerk and Ludwig von Mises; today, Austrian economists are from all over the world,
				and the term does not reflect nationality.
			</p>

			<h2> The Vertical Structure of Capital </h2>
			<p>
				I'd like to paint a mental picture for you. Understanding this is essential to the rest of the text.
			</p>
			<p>
				Imagine a two-dimensional grid divided into horizontal strips.
				In the bottom strip, place all consumer goods—that is, things people want because they directly provide value, like a meal or a chair.
				In the layer above that, place all producer goods which contribute directly to the creation of the consumer goods in the first layer.
				In the layer above that, place all producer goods which contribute directly to the creation of the producer goods in the second layer.
				Continue until you reach the highest layer for a given economy.
				Now you have a mental image of the capital structure.
			</p>
			<p>
				Note that in the capital structure, we are not including land or labor, because those two things are so universal that their inclusion would be redundant.
				Everything needs some labor to create and a place for that manufacture to occur.
			</p>
			<p>
				When we talk of the "vertical" structure of capital, we're referring to how much effort is allocated to each layer.
				Generally, as society progresses and the division of labor intensifies, the structure of production grows upward: more resources are invested in the higher layers.
				This is because longer production processes enable greater efficiency; for example, we could sew shirts with a handheld needle or a sewing machine.
				The needle requires fewer steps to create than the more intricate sewing machine, but putting in the initial effort to innovate the sewing machine ultimately allows us to produce shirts more efficiently.
			</p>
			<p>
				The capital structure also typically widens as society progresses, but that is less important for this subject.
			</p>

			<h2> Time Preference </h2>
			<p>
				Every individual has a time preference.
				We refer to "greater" time preference as valuing the immediacy of gratification relatively more.
				Lower time preference, then, is being more willing to wait to receive greater gratification.
				Using the shirt production example again, if most people's shirts were full of holes and winter was right around the corner, aggregate time preference would likely be high.
				Shirts would be needed immediately, even if the quality or quantity could be greater should everyone wait a while for sewing machines to be created.
			</p>

			<h2> Coordination </h2>
			<p>
				With capital structure and time preference in mind, you are ready to understand how these two things are coordinated in a complex social economy.
				For brevity, let's assume money and banking exist.
				There are analagous coordination mechanisms for less developed economies, but that's not the subject of this article.
				Coordination is crucial for a properly functioning social economy because people need to somehow communicate their preferences.
				Handling time preference decisions in one's personal economy is easy enough, but when participating in a social economy we cannot simply read eachother's minds; some other mechanism is needed.
			</p>
			<p>
				Let us start on the time preference side.
				Members of the social economy all have some amount of money which can be put to various uses.
				If aggregate time preference is high, people will use a greater portion of their money for buying goods immediately.
				If aggregate time preference is low, people will deposit that money in a time account (savings, certificate of deposit, money market, etc.) with the expectation that the bank will pay them a portion of any profits gained from lending.
				They can't use the money to buy things now, but they will be able to buy more later.
				Of course, more direct methods of investment exist, like stock brokerages, but most people don't have time to manage their investments alone, so some intermediary is entrusted with that task.
			</p>
			<p>
				Now let's look at this mechanism from the perspective of banks or other lending institutions. Hereafter I'll just say "banks" for convenience.
				If people are depositing more money in time accounts, banks have more money to work with when loaning as well as a greater debt to pay—more money means more interest is expected.
				This encourages banks to seek out more investments which, assuming banks always go for the least risky investments first, means they must be less picky about risk.
			</p>
			<p>
				For our purposes, we can divide the causes of risk into two categories, high time-to-completion and poor planning.
				A high time-to-completion means exactly what it says: the project will not yield profit until far in the future.
				I'm using "poor planning" as a catch-all for investments that simply are not good for various reasons, including an untrustworthy lendee, an idea with little supporting market research, etc.
				Naturally, banks needing to increase their risk would prefer to do so through well thought out, high time-to-completion projects rather than flat out ill-conceived projects.
			</p>
			<p>
				What sort of projects tend to be well thought out but will take a while to complete?
				Projects that vertically lengthen the structure of production; that is, projects which add more steps in order to achieve greater efficiency, like manufacturing the sewing machine from our earlier example.
				Putting resources into such an endeavor takes them away from immediate manufacture of clothing yet yields better and/or cheaper clothes in the future.
				This is exactly what consumers want when their time preference is low, thus coordination is achieved.
				I will leave the high time preference scenario as an exercise for the reader.
			</p>

			<h2> Promises </h2>
			<p>
				Banks do not conduct all transactions in actual money, whether that money is a commodity or some fiat.
				Instead, banks primarily issue promises, and these promises are believed so long as the bank's reputation remains good.
				Let's say, for example, that in a hypothetical economy gold is money.
				Bank Y possesses 100 ounces of physical gold in its warehouse and has issued warehouse certificates whose values total up to 100 ounces.
				Warehouse certificates are tokens (that could be paper, digital, etc.) that entitle the bearer to withdraw a given amount of a given commodity, in this case gold.
				Right now, Bank Y can clear all its outstanding debts; every certificate can be exchanged for actual gold wihout issues.
			</p>
			<p>
				Not all promises are warehouse certificates.
				Some promises include a time element, so we refer to these as "time accounts," which includes savings accounts, CDs, money market accounts, and similar offerings.
				However, these "promises" generally have stipulations; the customer is guaranteed some variable amount based on the level of success achieved by the bank in loaning that money to others.
				For now let's stick to fixed-amount promises, i.e. warehouse certificates.
			</p>
			<p>
				For convenience and efficiency, banks often forgive inter-bank debts temporarily.
				Say the customers of Bank Y, on net, have transfered warehouse certificates worth 20 ounces of gold to customers of Bank Z.
				The customers of Bank Z wish, for their convenience, to simply hand Bank Y certificates to Bank Z and have their account balance increase accordingly.
				As a result, a chain of debt is created: Bank Z has promised its customers 20 ounces of gold, and Bank Y has promised Bank Z 20 ounces of gold (since Bank Z is now the bearer of Y's certificates).
			</p>
			<p>
				Bank Z has every right to immediately demand resolution of the debt, but it would be logistically inconvenient to pay for such frequent transport of certificates to Bank Y and gold back from Bank Y.
				After all, the very next day could see a net debt of 20 ounces in the other direction, cancelling out the previous day's bank-to-bank debts.
				In such case, the only necessary action would be to exchange or deactivate the certificates, which is generally an easier task than transporting physical currency, especially if this hypothetical world has an Internet.
				So, to increase efficiency, Bank Z does not immediately demand resolution of this obligation, in the same way that Bank Y's customers hang on to Bank Y certificates instead of demanding their gold.
				This practice comes with a danger, namely that Bank Z is 20 ounces short of being able to resolve all its obligations to its customers unless some customers are willing to accept Bank Y certificates as a substitute for physical gold.
				Don't confuse this with "overnight loaning" in the real, centrally-controlled, fractional reserve banking world—that's a vaguely related but different practice.
			</p>
			<h2> Credit Expansion and Checks Thereon </h2>
			<p>
				Since banks deal in promises, a bank could promise more than it can possibly deliver.
				For example, Bank X might issue certificates promising 120 ounces of gold total while only having 100 ounces in the vault.
				In so doing, Bank X has given itself the purchasing power of 20 ounces of gold; for obvious reasons, bankers are incentivized to engage in this practice, so what limits them?
				A loose limit is imposed by the fact that customers will sometimes withdraw the physical currency; should this happen en masse, the bank's lie will be caught.
			</p>
			<p>
				However, in practice, <i>other banks</i> tend to moderate well before such a scenario occurs.
				Banks Y and Z do not want to lose purchasing power as a result of inflation caused by Bank X's overlending, so they will occasionally perform the financial equivalent a brake check by demanding resolution of debts owed by Bank X.
				They are more likely to do so if Bank X's operations seem suspicious, e.g. they see a relative abundance of customers depositing Bank X certificates, indicating Bank X may be overissuing.
				Thus each bank is kept in check by the rational desire of other banks not to lose purchasing power to inflation caused by a rogue bank's overissuance.
				Furthermore, it is actively profitable for Bank Y to catch Bank X overissuing because Bank X's certificates are plentiful and thus easy to come by.
				Demanding redemption of those certificates yields more gold than the certificates are really worth in terms of the certificate-to-gold ratio.
				The first ones to realize the situation and act on it will benefit at the overissuer's expense.
			</p>
			<p>
				
			</p>
			<h2> The Business Cycle Under Free Banking </h2>
			<h3> Overexpansion (or more accurately, Malinvestment) </h3>
			<p>
				The mechanism described above is not perfect; some degree of overissuance will still occur without being promptly caught.
				In any dynamical system, factors will occasionally align in such a way that some metric—in this case the apparent availability of money—is thrown off significantly.
				This causes a coordination error by making entrepreneurs believe there are more resources available than there actually are: interest rates decrease so money becomes "cheaper."
				Let's say consumers have, in sum, deposited 1,000 ounces of gold into time accounts.
				Due to an accumulation of overissuance, entrepreneurs, in sum, see lending conditions that are more in line with a total savings of 1,250 ounces.
				As a result, long-term projects which extend the production process seem relatively more attractive or viable than they should given the actual time preferences of consumers.
			</p>
			<p>
				These <i>malinvestments</i> essentially drain purchasing power away from lower stages of production and into the higher stages.
				We call this a <i>maladjustment of the vertical structure of capital</i>.
				Consumers would prefer entrepreneurs to put more resources into short-term projects which will quickly yield consumer goods.
				However, entrepreneurs don't know this yet because they receive loans through intermediaries such as banks rather than directly from consumers.
			</p>
			<p>
				It is vitally important to understand that this stage, not the crash, is when most damage is done.
				Wealth is tied up in efforts which will yield less value to market participants than other uses of the available resources would have.
				Potential wealth is thrown away.
			</p>
			<h3> Buildup to Crash </h3>
			<p>
				The unsustainable trajectory caused by malinvestment has several shorter-term consequences.
				One important effect is a rise in the prices of consumer goods as overissuance-caused inflation drains purchasing power from first-order producers.
				Why? Because producer goods are being bought up by entrepreneurs engaging in unsustainably long-term projects, driving up the prices of said goods.
				Higher prices, ceteris paribus, means less purchasing power.
				Producers of consumer goods, lacking the purchasing power to sufficiently expand their operations, will be unable to keep up with consumer demand to the extent they could under normal conditions.
				This will cause a shortage, increasing the prices of consumer goods.
			</p>
			<p>
				If this goes on for a while, first-order producers will accumulate money as their products are now exchangeable for more money.
				Seeing the lucrativity of consumer goods, said producers will use their newly-acquired money to expand their operations.
				In so doing, they will further drive up the prices of producer goods.
				This increases the cost to complete all those unsustainably long-term projects, so the misled entrepreneurs must either borrow even more or give up on their projects.
				Thus we have the conditions for a crash.
			</p>
			<h3> Realization of Error ("Crash") </h3>
			<p>
				The overexpansion may continue for some time if banks choose to continue issuing credit.
				However, as time goes on, banks become ever more likely to get caught with their proverbial pants down for two reasons:
				<ul>
					<li>Banks must issue more promises to keep unsustainable projects on life support</li>
					<li>Banks have less actual money as lower-order producers find it more profitable to use money to expand rather than invest it with a bank</li>
				</ul>
				Once the reality is seen, there will be a rush by both individuals and other banks to ensure their assets are safe.
				Any bank unable to clear its debts will have its reputation tarnished and its physical currency drained away as described before.
			</p>
			<p>
				Those banks' certificates will no longer be widely trusted, making their loans worth little (unless they loan physical gold instead of certificates).
				As a result, unsustainable projects will not find the continued investment needed to keep them on life support, as the very same banks willing to give such loans are the ones whose promises are no longer trusted.
				Either said banks will try to repair their reputations, in which case they will not continue risky loans; or they may continue overissuance, in which case their lendees will have certoficates most sellers don't trust.
				With this, misled entrepreneurs will see that their projects cannot be completed.
			</p>
			<h3> Contraction (or more accurately, Reparation) </h3>
			<p>
				Once a project fails, its investors will want to recuperate as much of their investment as possible.
				This includes the banks that overissued in the first place.
				The only way to recuperate money from a failed project is to sell off the capital to other entrepeneurs.
				This process mitigates the damage caused by maladjustment as capital is redistributed to more valuable uses.
			</p>
			<p>
				The less economically literate, some of whom call themselves economists, tend to see this period as the problem.
				In fact, the contraction or recession is analagous to a crime being reported and prosecuted, not a crime being committed.
			</p>
			<h2> The Business Cycle Under Central Banking </h2>
			<p>
				Now that you understand the business cycle under free banking, you can grasp how central banking throws off the correction mechanism.
				The basic issue is that central banking creates a cartel of banks that is shielded, de jure and/or de facto, from brake-checking by other banks and, in most cases, individuals as well.
				The cartel may be protected by explicit laws controlling the behavior of all financial institutions, or by legal tender laws.
				Legal tender laws create either a fully fiat currency or a "commodity-backed" currency which is nearly fiat because the exchange rate can be changed at will.
			</p>
			<p>
				The consequences being removed, the central bank and all its subordinate banks can overexpand credit in concert.
				There is no incentive for any member bank to act more responsibly, as their ability to profit by catching overissuers is taken away.
				Choosing not to expand credit is only detrimental as inflation will drain purchasing power.
			</p>
			<p>
				Because it is profitable for the cartel to expand credit, they will do so continually.
				This results in a sustained bout of malinvestment and consequent maladjustment which looks like economic growth to the miseducated.
				After all, if society is engaging in a great many long-term projects, things must be going well, right?
				It is difficult for any individual, without the proper theoretical knowledge and econometric data, to realize what is going on.
				The individual can evaluate his or her own time preference and see that the production structure does not suit him or her yet conclude that other people's time preferences must simply be different.
				This fact enables covert theft through inflation, but that is for a different article.
			</p>
			<p>
				Cartelization of the banks enables a level of maladjustment which would be astronomically unlikely otherwise.
				The greater the maladjustment, the more damage is done during the overexpansion period.
				The more damage is done, the greater the panic when the reality of that damage is revealed.
				The severe crashes and consequent drawn-out recessions or depressions we have seen over the last century or so are consequences of central banking and misguided economic theory.
			</p>
			<p>
				Even after the crash, the cartel does not stop.
				In fact, the overissuance often accelerates as so-called experts recommend "stimulus" to "fix" the economy.
				Whether they are ignorant or malicious, I will let the reader decide.
				Such policy prevents capital from being redistributed through liquidation of ill-conceived projects, blocking the healing mechanism.
				First-order producers continue to have high costs, increasing prices for consumers.
			</p>
			<p>
				Working and middle class consumers, largely being on a salary or wage, will have their income lag behind the inflation, decreasing their purchasing power.
				Even if some ill-conceived project is completed, these consumers will not have the purchasing power to justify so much production.
				The new business will fail to turn a profit and have to close, or some existing business or businesses will lose out to the new one and collapse.
				Failed businesses need to liquidate, which is not a perfectly efficient process, as there are logistical costs to transferring and repurposing capital.
				There is no way to avoid net loss once maladjustment has occurred.
				However, industries which serve the political class may see growth.
			</p>
			<h2> Conclusions </h2>
			<p>
				I hope this article was enlightening and understandable.
				Naturally I have glossed over some details for the sake of brevity.
				There is a great deal more to learn about monetary systems and financial institutions.
				Also note that I am not as advanced in the Austrian School as others may be; I am still learning, so I'm happy to receive corrections and feedback.
