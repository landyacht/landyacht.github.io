			<h1> Against Empiricism in Economics and Politics </h1>

			<p>
				Empirical epistemology pervades and dominates modern science, politics, academics, and broader culture.
				Many take it to be the default—or even the only acceptable—epistemology.
				This article will argue against the use of empiricism in economics and "public policy" (politics).
				The arguments presented here are not original;
					rather, this is a condensation and aggregation of existing ideas from Mises, Rothbard, Hoppe, etc.
			</p>
			<p>
				The core assertion of empiricism is:
				<i>All statements (propositions) can be categorized by whether
					they convey knowledge of reality.
				Those that do are called </i>synthetic propositions<i>, and those that do not are called
					</i>analytic propositions<i>.
				</i>(These terms originated in Kant's work but were adopted and modified slightly by empiricists.)
				<i>Synthetic propositions must be falsifiable, while analytic propositions are merely restatements
					of definitions and thus can be identified as true or false through logical deduction alone.</i>
			</p>
			<p>
				Falsifiable means that there exists, at least in theory, a real-world experiment whose outcome could
					falsify (prove wrong) the proposition.
				If the experimental result fails to falsify the proposition, that does not prove the proposition is
					absolutely true; in fact, no amount of successful experiments can ever do so.
				For example, I could propose that all humans have their heart located on their right side.
				This would be easy to empirically validate again and again, but in reality some people have a condition
					which (benignly) causes their organs to be mirrored.
				Thus, with empiricist epistemology, there is no absolutely certain knowledge about reality.
			</p>
			<p>
				Empiricism is well-suited for the physical sciences because experiments can be isolated in a
					laboratory and their conditions tightly controlled, minimizing the odds of believing an incorrect
					proposition due to confounding factors.
				Small, limited-scope propositions can be formulated and tested, and the testing of incorrect
					propositions is unlikely to bring about severe consequences (at least directly).
				For example, if I make a claim about aerodynamics, I can test this claim with a wind tunnel where the
					conditions are easily controlled and the worst conceivable consequence is some sort of explosion.
			</p>
			<p>
				Before moving on to the more limited critique of empiricism, I should mention that Hans-Hermann Hoppe
					lays out a complete takedown of it in his works.
				In short, Hoppe assumes for the sake of argument that the core assertion of empiricism is correct,
					then he asks whether that core assertion itself is a synthetic or analytic proposition.
				If it is analytic, then it conveys no knowledge of reality and is thus useless for scientific inquiry.
				If it is synthetic, then it must be falsifiable, in which case we reach a contradiction because
					there is no conceivable real-world experiment which could falsify the core assertion.
			</p>
			<p>
				Regardless of how satisfied we are with Hoppe's argument, there are other criticisms worth mentioning
					when it comes to empricism as applied in economics and public policy.
				First, the empirical method becomes markedly less effective when we are unable to isolate experiments
					and control their conditions.
				This is the case for economics and politics because these things inherently involve human beings,
					and it is profoundly unethical and impractical to completely isolate people in a controlled
					environment for periods of time long enough to produce meaningful results.
				Furthermore, even with voluntary participants in a controlled environment, it is impossible to erase
					the differences in their genetics and upbringing.
				The other option would be not to control these factors but to account for them in the formulation of
					the hypothesis (that is, do a field study or look at historical data instead of doing a laboratory
					experiment), but this is an insurmountable task due to the sheer number of variables.
				Physical and cultural conditions vary too much across time and space for historical analysis or field
					studies to be effective.
			</p>
			<p>
				Second, experimentation on the general populace via policy is unlike a laboratory experiment where the
					consequences of bad hypotheses are limited.
				Rather, such experimentation can result in mass famine, mass impoverishment, violent clashes, widespread
					health issues, etc.
				This is made all the worse by the endless iterative nature of empiricist methodology:
					if a proposition is falsified, it tends to be reformulated with some extra clauses rather than
					thrown out entirely.
				The reformulated proposition is again tested, potentially producing yet another disaster.
				For the empiricist in the public sphere, there is no end condition, no point at which they are forced
					to admit their ignorance and cease their experimentation.
				Human beings cannot be treated as test subjects on which to repeatedly refine a proposition which may
					be entirely off the mark to begin with.
			</p>

				"<i>Just one more clause on this hypothesis and we'll get it right...</i>"
