			<h1> Welcome to my blog! </h1>
			<p>
				Here I plan to write about various things that interest me (assuming I find the motivation) including but not limited to:
			</p>
			<ul>
   				<li> Raku </li>
				<li> Programming in general </li>
				<li> Video games </li>
				<li> Investing and Finance </li>
				<li> Economics </li>
				<li> Cooking </li>
				<li> Philosophy and Mysticism </li>
				<li> Survival/bushcraft </li>
				<li> Traditional crafts </li>
				<li> Interior design </li>
			</ul>
			<p>
				And hopefully never politics.
			</p>

			<h2> You may wonder... </h2>
			<h3> Who are you? </h3>
			<p>
				You might know me as Rogue or Rouking. I'm a Raku fanatic with an interest in lots of other topics ranging from food to economics.
				My long-term goal is to be an entrepreneur, but right now I am a mere cog in the software engineering machine.

			</p>
			<h3> Why does this site look like ass? </h3>
			<p>
				Hey, I take offense to that. Maybe you're right. My tastes in web design are somewhat <a href="https://www.motherfuckingwebsite.com/" target="_blank">motherfuckingwebsite</a>-esque.
			</p>
			<h3> What static site gen did you use? </h3>
			<p>
				I have this great one called Vim. I just enter <span class="inline-code">vim something.html</span> and type in some HTML. It's all very Web 5.0.
			</p>
			<h3> I'd rather read someone else's blog. </h3>
			<p>
				That's not a question, but I understand, so here are some people worth listening to:
				<a href="http://jnthn.net/" target="_blank">Jonathan Worthington</a>,
				<a href="http://damian.conway.org/" target="blank">Damian Conway</a>,
				<a href="https://liz.nl/" target="_blank">Elizabeth Mattijsen</a>,
				<a href="http://tomwoods.com/" target="_blank">Tom Woods</a>,
				and I would say Larry Wall, but I don't think he'd appreciate that.
