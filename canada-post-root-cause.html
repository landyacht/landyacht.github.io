			<h1> Subsidy &amp; Suffering: The Story of Canada Post </h1>

			<p>
				On November 15, 2024, the Canadian Union of Postal Workers (CUPW) <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/business/canada-post-strike-faq-1.7384539">began a nationwide strike</a> that stopped delivery of mail including
				<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/CanadaPost/comments/1h0j5we/strike_holding_medication_hostage/">essential medication</a>,
				<a href="https://globalnews.ca/news/10900908/canada-post-strike-disruptions-list/">passports, charitable donations, at-home screening kits</a>,
				<a href="https://www.epcor.com/ca/en/news/notices/2024-11-13-how-to-avoid-delayed-bills-with-the-canada-post-strike.html">bills</a>,
				<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/CanadaPost/comments/1h80zki/im_not_getting_paycheques_because_of_this_strike">paycheques</a>,
				<a href="https://www.thunderbay.ca/en/news/payment-and-invoice-processing-updates-during-canada-post-strike.aspx">payments</a>,
				other important notices and documents, and, of course, Christmas presents.
				As of the time of writing (December 8, 2024), this strike is still ongoing, and delivery of mail is still suspended.
			</p>
			<p>
				Naturally, many people are scared or outraged about the situation.
				Even with so many services being online now, physical mail still plays a crucial role in the functioning of society;
					this nearly month-long suspension of service comes with consequences for individuals and businesses ranging from minor inconveniences to emergencies.
				Widespread outrage is absolutely justified, but in order to make meaningful change, that anger must be directed appropriately by understanding the root cause.
				So, let's be clear about the nature of the situation: <b>this is a spat between two special-privilege groups</b>—Canada Post and CUPW—that, because of their special privileges,
					has a massive negative impact on society for which those affected are unlikely to ever receive fair compensation.
			</p>

			<h2> Special Privileges </h2>
			<p>
				What special privileges am I talking about? Let's look at each entity in turn.
			</p>
			<h3> Canada Post </h3>
			<p>
				Canada Post is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crown_corporation">Crown Corporation</a> with a government-enforced monopoly on letter mail services (<i>Canada Post Corporation Act</i>, §14).
				Competitors must charge at least thrice Canada Post's rate for delivering letter mail "of an urgent nature" to comply with the Act (see §15.1.e).
				In addition, its status as a Crown Corporation means Canada Post is subsidized by the government with taxpayer funds.
				As such, the usual profit incentive to provide better service than the competition is not relevant for Canada Post, and any inefficiencies will be covered on the taxpayer dime.
				In fact, for the past 6 years, the Corporation has
					<a href="https://www.canadapost-postescanada.ca/cpc/en/our-company/financial-and-sustainability-reports/2023-annual-report/our-financial-picture.page">operated at a loss</a>.
			</p>
			<p>
				While a monopoly on letter mail alone seems somewhat limited, these are often the most crucial pieces of mail.
				Financial statements, bills, bill payments, and legal notices from banks, courts, government entities, employers, and others are all letter mail.	
				To add insult to injury, Canada Post is not required to compensate their customers for delays and damages caused by strikes (according to their
					<a href="https://www.canadapost-postescanada.ca/cpc/doc/en/support/customer-guide/section_7_terms_and_conditions.pdf">terms and conditions</a>, subsection 21.10.1),
					nor can individuals retrieve their mail from a warehouse themselves.
				In other words, regardless of how hard you're screwed or how much you're taxed to subsidize Canada Post, you have very little in the way of legal remedies.
			</p>
			<h3> CUPW </h3>
			<p>
				As a public-sector union, the CUPW gets many special privileges under the <a href="https://canlii.ca/t/56c09">Canada Labour Code</a>.
				For one, their employer may not fire them for participating in a strike (87.6, 94.3.a.vi).
				The employer also may not hire replacement workers nor have other employees perform the striking employees' functions (94.2.1).
				Additionally, although I could not track down the exact legal basis for this, it seems to be common knowledge that almost all postal workers, with a few exemptions, must join the CUPW or at least pay dues;
					this includes temporary workers hired for the holiday season.
			</p>
			<p>
				In summary, rather than being a voluntary organization, CUPW occupies a privileged position where it is essentially guaranteed funding and shielded from negative consequences.
			</p>

			<h2> Gaining Perspective on the Problem </h2>
			<p>
				Getting an accurate perspective on this situation requires setting aside red-team vs. blue-team mentality.
				Both Canada Post and the CUPW should have the liberty to associate, or not associate, with one another.
				That means the Union can choose to strike at any time (with no 3-day notice requirement) and with any demands, and it means the Corporation can terminate employees at its discretion.
				Any requirement that the two parties continue to associate with one another against their wishes is tantamount to slavery and is logically and morally unjustifiable.
				See Chapter 2, Section 11 of Rothbard's <i>Man, Economy, and State</i> for a more in-depth analysis.
			</p>
			<p>
				Without special privileges, the impact of a dispute such as the one ongoing would be minimized.
				If Canada Post had to play by the same rules as private entities, customers could sue for damages caused by the disruption, society would not be required to fund the Corporation through taxes,
					and open competition would mean less mail is stuck with a single, monopoly entity.
				If the CUPW lacked special privileges, Canada Post could hire workers to get mail moving again during the strike, and employees who do not wish to participate in the Union would not be extorted for dues.
			</p>
			<p>
				Because of government-granted special privileges, what should be an isolated and minimally impactful dispute is instead a nationwide disaster.
				Innocent people who have had their natural rights stripped by the Canada Labour Code and Canada Post Corporation Act are suffering, and their suffering is being used as a bargaining chip by these two
					privileged groups.
				Whichever party "wins" the dispute, Canadians and all those who do commerce in Canada will lose.
			</p>
			
			<h2> Realizing the Solution </h2>
			<p>
				If you want real and lasting change, don't hate the player, hate the game.
				Of course, it's fine to be upset at those who abuse their privileged positions at your expense.
				However, always maintain focus on the root cause—the assignment of special privileges and subsidies to certain groups.
				If those are not taken away, the problem will not be solved permanently, and even though the current disaster may pass, another will come.
			</p>
			<p>
				For real change, demand that the government...
				<ol>
					<li> Revoke Canada Post's monopoly on letter mail and immunity from lawsuits </li>
					<li> Discontinue all subsidies to Canada Post, making it compete on even ground on the free market </li>
					<li> Repeal or revise the Canada Labour Act so that freedom of association is returned to employers and employees including...
						<ol>
							<li> Liberty of either party to terminate employment at will with no notice </li>
							<li> Liberty of the employee to strike with no notice </li>
							<li> Liberty of the employer to hire replacement workers during a strike or at any other time </li>
							<li> Liberty of union members to leave said union at any time and for any reason </li>
						</ol>
					</li>
					<li> Allow affected citizens to recover their mail from warehouses themselves with a court order </li>
				</ol>
