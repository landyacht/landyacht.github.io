			<h1> Dementia </h1>
			<p>
				<i> This article touches on some heavy themes. Skip it if you're not in the right mental state for that.
				Also, the "latest" link will not link to this. </i>
			</p>
			<p>
				I wonder, if someone with severe dementia had a moment of lucidity, would they want to keep living?
				If presented with the option of a painless suicide, would they take it?
			</p>
			<p>
				I wonder, is dementia as painful for the demented as for those who love them?
				Can those suffering from the awful disease still enjoy their lives?
			</p>
			<p>
				And am I a bad person for wishing she had died instead?
				Died, instead of being taken from me piece by piece?
				Died, instead of a shell of her being left?
			</p>
			<p>
				Am I weak for falling apart at the thought of the person I knew and loved being there but gone?
				For crumbling under the uncertainty of whether she is really still with us?
				Of not having closure, not being able to comprehend what exactly happened?
			</p>
			<p>
				Am I awful for being unable to face her once I understood the situation?
				Even though I know that shell, that spirit, still loved me and wanted to see me?
			</p>
			<p>
				Will the other people I love face the same slow decay, the same self-unaware fading-out?
				Will I one day succumb to that disease for which there is no known cure?
				Will medical science advance enough before any of this happens?
			</p>
			<p>
				I don't know the answer to any of those questions.
				We can only hang in suspense, quietly hoping, wishing both good and evil things, both selfish and selfless things.
