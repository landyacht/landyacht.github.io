			<h1> Embrace the Detail Bog to Progress </h1>
			<p>
				I have a lot of failed personal programming projects in my past.
				For some of them, "failed" almost feels like an overstatement of my achievement, because failure implies something was started.
			</p>
			<p>
				These projects never got off the ground for a number of reasons.
				Early on it was largely due to my own lack of knowledge;
					I bit off more than I could chew given my level of expertise at the time.
				Trying to implement an HTTP server from the ground up in C# is not a task for a (relative) beginner.
			</p>
			<p>
				In fact, it was that particular project which led to a shift in my mode of failure, or rather my mode of non-starting.
				Like in previous failed projects, I had some very specific ideas which I got overly bogged down in.
				I was excited about these features, but I eventually realized I needed a skeleton for the project before I could start on them, and that's where things went south.
				Structuring a large project well was beyond my capacity at the time, yet that didn't stop me from trying.
				I spent hours thinking through it, only to become frustrated when my brain was unable to contain the entirety of the architecture in short- or mid-term memory.
				Then I tried putting some ideas into actual code, but it turned into a mess because I hadn't properly architected it.
			</p>
			<p>
				I took an incorrect lesson away from that experience, which was that getting bogged down in details leads to failure.
				That lesson isn't entirely devoid of truth, because spending too much time on details without getting the bigger picture is problematic.
				However, I believed that I needed to completely architect something and fully understand it before I could even write a character of code.
				That belief persisted for many years and doomed many of my projects.
				Trying to fully architect a solution up front is asking for frustration and burnout, because many questions can't be answered until the rubber meets the road.
			</p>
			<p>
				Up until somewhat recently, I felt so defeated that I gave up on the idea of actually doing any personal projects.
				At most I would write small bits of code for fun, but anytime a larger project idea came up I would remind myself of my track record and give up before it even began.
			</p>
			<p>
				Now enter the latest iteration of Quot, an idea I've had for years and which has been through many revisions and cycles of inspiration and burnout.
				My most recent attempt at it, which has actually spanned several years of off-and-on planning, is finally to that rubber-meets-the-road stage.
				I've actually written some code for it, and I have a much better feeling this time.
				So what changed, and why do I see light at the end of the tunnel after years of defeatism?
			</p>
			<p>
				<b> Reason 1: Acceptance that it will take time. </b>
				Rome wasn't built in a day, and neither was any worthwhile piece of software.
				Desperation to complete things contributed to my burnout.
				In your teens, a few years seems like an unacceptably long timeline, but now I feel comfortable saying that Quot will take years.
				Along with this comes an understanding that putting something down doesn't mean it's dead.
				It's okay to take a break and come back, which is what I did many times while refining Quot's architecture.
				Although it worked out, I didn't explicitly think about that lesson at the time.
			</p>
			<p>
				<b> Reason 2: Being a better developer. </b>
				This one is simple: I'm better at software development than I was before.
				I have both more technical knowledge gained through formal and informal study and more practical experience with design principles gained though my day job.
			</p>
			<p>
				<b> Reason 3: Making use of motivation. </b>
				Human beings go through cycles when it comes to motivation.
				It's normal and unavoidable, but it can be deeply frustrating (and is probably worse for people like me with ADHD).
				The key is to use motivation when it's there, producing results that last and can be built upon.
				For me, this means actually writing things down, diagramming, and coding instead of just keeping those ideas in my head.
				It also means, in combination with Reason 1, that I shouldn't be discouraged from using my motivation just because I know it's temporary and that I won't accomplish everything in one go.
			</p>
			<p>
				Reasons 1 and 3 together constitute the crucial shift in thinking that synthesizes my past experiences and achieves a balanced approach which actually works.
				I took the necessary time to architect the project, creating diagrams and skeleton code to formalize my ideas, but I didn't drive myself mad trying to understand every single aspect in one go.
				Instead, I allowed myself to iterate and come back later with a fresh perspective, often leading to me tossing out old ideas.
				Being able to let go of old ideas once their flaws become clear is vital, but so is keeping around the parts that work.
			</p>
			<p>
				At the same time, I allowed myself to get bogged down in aspects that excited me, and since the skeleton was more or less in place, I was able to do so while keeping the context limited.
				In the past, diving deep on one component like that would raise too many questions about other, undecided aspects of the project, leading to mental overload.
				With a rough but thorough skeleton in place, I am able to dive deep with boundaries to preserve sanity;
					that being said, even with boundaries, it requires conscious effort not to wander off.
				Recently, I wrote my first few chunks of non-skeleton code for the project, and I am very happy with the results (maybe there will be another, more technical post about this).
				I no longer feel a sense of impending doom as the pieces fail to fit together; instead I feel confident that the project will succeed spectacularly.
			</p>
			<p>
				What I'd like the reader to take away is that you should find balance between the big picture and the details, and accept and adapt to cycles in motivation.
				Keep the architecture general enough that design doesn't burn you out (easier said than done), and allow yourself to take advantage of bouts of motivation without worrying about order too much.
				The latter part might seem to violate conventional wisdom—that you should go for a stripped-down MVP first and add the cool stuff later—but it's better to get something done than nothing,
					better to have some sense of accomplishment than to feel held back by doing things in "the right order" or to get discouraged because there is so much to do before results become visible.
				Find what works for you and remember that anything is better than giving up before you start.
