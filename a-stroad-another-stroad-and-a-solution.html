			<h1> A Stroad, Another Stroad, and a Solution: A Response to Not Just Bikes- and Strong Towns-Style Arguments </h1>
			<p>
				<i>Stroad</i> is a portmanteau of street and road where each of those words is taken to have a specific meaning.
				In this context, road refers to something people use to get from point A to point B;
					street refers to a place where people linger, wander, shop, or hang out.
				A stroad, then, is something that tries to be both and, because the goals of the two are more or less incompatible, fails at one, the other, or both.
			</p>
			<p>
				YouTube channels like Not Just Bikes, Strong Towns, and others complain a lot about stroads and related issues, but their complaints are typically directed at stroads that lean more toward being roads.
				In fact, I'd like to start by saying that calling something a stroad does not make it one, and ascribing certain goals to a structure does not mean those were the goals in mind when it was built.
				The usual road-leaning stroad complaints are that they are unfriendly and/or unsafe for pedestrians/bicyclists and that they utilize space inefficiently.
				But those are only problems if we assume that pedestrian friendliness or efficient space utilization are goals to begin with, when in many cases they are not because they don't need to be.
				North America (the usual setting for these dicussions) is a large place;
					it doesn't make sense to assume that everywhere should or even <i>can</i> be pedestrian-oriented.
			</p>
			<p>
				But let's assume our goal is indeed to accomodate pedestrians, creating safe places that encourage socialization, commerce (especially with local businesses), or simply relaxation.
				Then road-leaning stroads do, in fact, fail to accomplish the specified goal.
				However, the solution offered by these YouTube pundits is quite often merely another variant of stroad, one that leans more toward being a street.
				This comes with a number of problems:
				<ol>
					<li> The structure is still trying to achieve both goals, except now it fails at being a road instead. </li>
					<li> Street-leaning stroads typically include street parking which is dangerous for motorists and pedestrians alike. </li>
					<li> Street-leaning stroads have poor out-of-town visitor accessibility, which stunts local businesses by driving away potential customers. </li>
					<li> Efficient utilization of space is still limited vertically because there is typically only one walkway, the one at ground level.  </li>
				</ol>
				Let's dive into each, then I'll show that there is a solution.
			</p>
			<h3> The Failure to be a Road </h3>
			<p>
				People need ways to get from point A to point B.
				Now, I'm sure NJB/ST are not advocating for the complete abolition of roads, but roads are typically left out of the discussion.
				What we need is not to convert road-leaning stroads into street-leaning stroads haphazardly, but rather to carefully create a tiered architecture.
				<ol>
					<li>
						At the top tier are major roads like interstate or state highways.
						These should have extremely limited access to allow high speeds safely and any walkways/bikeways which parallel them should have significant physical separation.
					</li>
					<li>
						At the next tier are somewhat limited access roads which act as more local thoroughfares, getting people from one part of town to another, which should again have significant physical separation from any walkways.
						These would be physically similar to the road-leaning stroads NJB/ST complain about, but we would not pretend that they are meant to act as streets.
						They might have restaurants, strip malls, or offices near them, but those businesses would be accessed by first exiting onto a lower tier.
					</li>
					<li>
						Said lower tier should <i>never</i> be necessary to cross through in getting from point A to point B.
						They should simply be the first and/or last leg in any given car or bus journey, getting motorists from their home to the next tier, or from the next tier to their destination.
						When I say destination, I mean their destination for the motorized portion of the journey.
					</li>
					<li>
						Their ultimate destination may lie yet another tier down, on bona-fide streets where cars simply cannot go
							(except for special circumstances like deliveries, but the infrastructure for that should be separated as much as possible from pedestrian infrastructure).
					</li>
				</ol>
			</p>
			<p>
				Street-leaning stroads are nightmares for motorists.
				This problem is overlooked or dismissed by NJB/ST because their goals are narrowly pedestrian- and bicyclist-oriented.
				The traffic congestion created by narrow, crowded street-leaning stroads, however, is not just a problem for drivers:
					it creates a less safe and less pleasant experience for pedestrians and bicyclists as well, especially in combination with street parking, which I'll expand upon shortly.
				These problems can be mitigated by making sure that there are proper roads which get motorists through or around pedestrian-oriented areas with minimal interaction.
				That means being selective about which stroads are street-ified so that throughways are left and a "traffic swamp" is not created by the necessity of passing through a pedestrian-oriented place.
				While that may solve the problem for local traffic familiar with the area, it does not address outsiders passing through or stopping by.
				Navigation applications like Google Maps are notorious for routing people through areas that don't make sense simply because the route is technically shorter.
				Part of the solution is making streets, as I mentioned above, that lowest tier where cars simply cannot go.
				The other part I'll touch on below.
			</p>
			<h3> Street Parking </h3>
			<p>
				The "positive" examples presented of "successfully" converted stroads almost invariably include street parking, whether it be parallel, diagonal, or perpendicular.
				This should be a massive red flag for anyone who has had to deal with street parking, especially as an outsider.
				Street parking is inefficient, unpleasant, and dangerous to drivers and pedestrians alike.
			</p>
			<h4> Dangers to Drivers </h4>
			<p>
				First let's look at parallel parking.
				Issue number one is many people simply don't know how to do it, leading to congestion and frustration; and of course frustration leads to anger leads to danger.
				We could argue that everyone should know how to parallel park, but reality is different, and we must work within the bounds of reality.
				Issue number two is that parallel parking leaves the driver exiting on the traffic side, which again is dangerous for the driver and creates congestion.
				The only saving grace of parellel is the driver can easily see oncoming traffic using their side mirror, which leads into the problem with diagonal parking, namely a lack of visibility.
				The nature of diagonal parking almost always puts the opaque parts of the car next to you in the way of your vision, to an extent that backing out is a matter of guessing and "going for it."
				A structure that requires "going for it" is a terrible structure.
				The problem with perpendicular parking is the same but of a lesser degree.
				It's usually easier, compared to diagonal, to see through the glass of the cars next to you whether someone is coming, but that's not always the case.	
			</p>
			<h4> Dangers to Pedestrians & Bicyclists </h4>
			<p>
				All types of street parking create a common danger, which is that a line of parked cars is a visibility barrier to anyone attempting to cross the road.
				This is exacerbated if the pedestrians in question are children, wheelchair-bound, or have a condition that stunts their physical growth.
				It is also exacerbated by the prevalence of SUVs and large trucks, which even tall adults cannot see over.
				The second danger is unique to diagonal and perpendicular street parking, and is worse for perpendicular.
				Imagine there is a park (as in, a place with trees and such, not a parking spot) nearby and you have people carrying picnic or sports equipment in their trunk.
				Their trunks will be on the traffic side, which not only presents an obvious danger to them, but it can also create confusion for motorists:
					"Is this person about to jaywalk?"
				And again, confusion leads to frustration which leads to anger which leads to danger.
				This is exacerbated when out-of-town motorists are already frustrated by complex layouts and traffic congestion.
			</p>
			<h4> Inefficient Space Utilization </h4>
			<p>
				Speaking of out-of-town motorists, we have already touched on the issue of navigation apps and the need for throughways to prevent traffic swamps.
				Street parking has another issue which relates to the final two points below, and that is how it offers relatively little parking space for those not within walkable/cyclable range.
				Not only that, what space it does use could otherwise be used for a wider sidewalk or bikeway.
			</p>
			<h3> Visitor Accessibility </h3>
			<p>
				Street-leaning stroads work decently for those who live close to the area in question, but that is inherently a limited demographic.
				Local businesses often need patronage from outside to survive.
				Street-parking-riddled, confusingly-laid-out traffic swamps drive away longer-distance visitors due to their aggravation factor and the flat-out lack of parking capacity.
				Many spaces have parking lots to address this, but they are often located somewhere in the middle, creating a problem which ties back to the tiered architecture I mentioned earlier.
				Parking areas being in the middle necessitates higher tiers of infrastructure to get motorists from outside into their destination, the parking lot.
				Having roads running through an otherwise pedestrian-oriented area is a recipe for failure.
			</p>
			<h3> Limited Vertical Space Usage </h3>
			<p>
				While the buildings adjacent to street-leaning stroads can be arbitrarily tall, the overall capacity of the area is limited by the only walkway generally being at ground level.
				It's very difficult to retrofit a solution to this when buildings were designed to have their entrances at ground level.
			</p>
			<h2> The Solution </h2>
			<p>
				The solution is malls. That's it.
				Well, okay, there are some other criteria, but consider how many problems the mall solves regardless.
				<ol>
					<li>
						The mall does not necessitate stroads of any sort:
							it needs a road (not a stroad, a true road) for motorists to get to it, and then the interior can entirely pedestrian-oriented.
						This avoids all the problems and dangers inherent to mixing automobiles and pedestrians.
					</li>
					<li>
						The streets inside malls can have far more seating for people to rest, eat, and socialize because no space is taken up by cars.
					</li>
					<li>
						Malls can easily make good use of vertical space because upper floors only need to support people, not cars.
					</li>
					<li>
						Indoor malls can continue to operate in inclement weather (rainy, windy, too hot, too cold), unlike "downtown" areas with street-leaning stroads open to the elements.
					</li>
					<li>
						Shared bathroom infrastructure brings down maintenance for businesses and makes for a more pleasant experience for visitors;
							compare this to the too-often difficult task of finding somewhere to piss in a big city.
					</li>
					<li>
						Shared parking infrastructure can also be made much more space-efficient by multi-layer parking decks, the cost of which is justified by the density of businesses inside.
						Such parking decks make it easy for out-of-town guests to come and give their patronage to local businesses, and when combined with properly tiered infrastructure eliminate the traffic swamp issue.
					</li>
					<li>
						Malls can also be privately owned, creating a financial incentive to maintain good infrastructure and cleanliness lest guests stop coming.
					</li>
					<li>
						In the same vein, improvements to the mall as consumer preferences evolve need not go through any governmental bureaucracy, and frivolous changes which have no basis in consumer preference will be avoided.
					</li>
					<li>
						Lastly, unpleasant characters are easier to eject from malls, leading to a safer experience where parents can feel comfortable allowing their children to roam and socialize.
					</li>
				</ol>
			</p>
			<h3> Caveats </h3>
			<p>
				As I already hinted at, the existence of malls alone is not enough to entirely address the problems at hand.
				Malls need to exist in the context of properly tiered infrastructure.
				For one, the mall should be located in a place that is accessible to local shoppers with infrastructure to allow pedestrian/bicycle entry.
				Two, the mall should be located near a high-tier road and be accessible from said road without directing traffic through lower-tier infrastructure unrelated to the mall itself.
				This ensures longer-distance visitors have a pleasant experience without creating inconvenience to locals.
			</p>
			<p>
				Finally, I would like to mention that malls can be of any size.
				A medium-sized town can have a relatively small mall while a major city might have multiple large malls.
				There are very few limits on scale.
			</p>
			<h2> Conclusion </h2>
			<p>
				In summary, turning one type of stroad into another is a non-solution and can even exacerbate problems if done haphazardly.
				Infrastructure needs to be properly tiered to avoid the conflicts that arise from mixed pedestrian-motorist spaces.
				Malls, which are already a well-known structure, address the problems with stroads if built in combination with properly tiered infrastructure.
