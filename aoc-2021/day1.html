			<h1> AoC 2021 Day 1 in Raku - Easy with rotor </h1>

			<h2> Part 1 </h2>
			<p>
				Here we are tasked with finding how many times there is an increase between consecutive integers in a list.
				The input is given to us linebreak-delimited, and I saved this in a file called <span class="inline-code">input-1-1.txt</span>.
				We will use the <span class="inline-code">.IO</span> method on a string containing this filename to get a handle object, then the <span class="inline-code">.lines</span> method on that to get a list of lines.
			</p>
			<p>
				Now, the data must be structured so we can run a comparison on each consecutive pair of integers,
					which is easily done with the <span class="inline-code"><a target="_blank" href="https://docs.raku.org/routine/rotor">rotor</a></span> method.
				Think of <span class="inline-code">rotor</span>'s arguments as a list of instructions which it steps through; in this case there is only one instruction, a <span class="inline-code">Pair</span> of 2 and -1.
				This means to take two elements to make a list, then step back one element (taking elements steps it forward).
				The result of this method is a list of lists.
			</p>
			<p>
				We can now make the comparisons using a mapping.
				Because <span class="inline-code">&lt;</span> is always numeric comparison, it coerces its operands to numbers, so we need not worry about explicity parsing strings into integers.
				Each list is passed into the anonymous subroutine, which has no parameter list, so the argument gets called <span class="inline-code">$_</span> by default.
			</p>
			<p>
				The result of the mapping is a list of booleans, which are reduced using the reduction metaoperator, <span class="inline-code">[ ]</span>, with the addition operator as its argument.
				The addition operator is always numeric, so it coerces the booleans to numbers, namely 1 or 0, so the sum does exactly what we want.
				I could have used the <span class="inline-code">.sum</span> method here too, but I like metaoperators.
			</p>
			<div class="snippet">
say [+] 'input-1-1.txt'.IO.lines.rotor(2 =&gt; -1).map: { $_[0] &lt; $_[1] }<br/>
			</div>

			<h2>Part 2</h2>
			<p>
				Here we have a similar task but with a sliding 3-element window whose values get summed. A similar method is used, but we insert two extra method calls to structure this window and create the window sums.
				It should be self-explanatory if you understand what <span class="inline-code">rotor</span> does now.
				Only one note for non-Perl, non-Raku programmers: <span class="inline-code">&amp;</span> is used before the name of a subroutine to refer to it as an object (as opposed to calling it).
			</p>

say [+] 'input-1-1.txt'.IO.lines<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.rotor(3 =&gt; -2)<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.map(&amp;sum)<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.rotor(2 =&gt; -1)<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.map: { $_[0] &lt; $_[1] }<br/>
