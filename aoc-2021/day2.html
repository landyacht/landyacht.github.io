			<h1> AoC 2021 Day 2 in Raku - Classifying and getting triangular </h1>

			<h2> Part 1 </h2>
			<p>
				Here we are given a list of vertical and horizontal movement instructions.
				In the horiztonal direction, we only move <span class="inline-code">forward</span>; in the vertical direction, we may go deeper (<span class="inline-code">down</span>) or shallower (<span class="inline-code">up</span>).
				Again the data is given to us line-delimited, so the first chunk of code should look familiar.
			</p>
			<p>
				The overall challenge, which is to find the product of the final horizontal and vertical position (the starting point being the origin), is simple once the data is massaged a bit.
				To massage it, I used the <span class="inline-code"><a target="_blank" href="https://docs.raku.org/routine/classify">classify</a></span> method.
				This method splits a list of inputs into any number of classes.
				The return value of the classification function we pass in determines what class any given value falls under.
				The quickest test for this is to see if the instruction starts with <span class="inline-code">forward</span>.
				I didn't actually need to spell out "horizontal" and "vertical" in the classification function as those keys are never used, but I thought it added clarity.
			</p>
			<p>
				The <span class="inline-code">as</span> named parameter made the challenge quite easy; it allows each value to be transformed after classification.
				Because the instructions are a word then a number, it felt natural to replace the word (and the space after it) with either a negative sign or nothing, depending on the intended effect.
				Note that <span class="inline-code">subst</span>'s second parameter defaults to an empty string.
				In the first instance, I used a string for the search pattern, but in the second instance there were two possible values, so a regex was used.
				Note that Raku regexes are different from (read "better than") PCREs: brackets denote a non-capturing group. <span class="inline-code">\h</span> refers to any horizontal whitespace.
			</p>
			<p>
				The result of this classification is a hashmap whose keys are the class names and whose values are lists of the items in the respective class.
				We don't care about the keys here, so I just took out the values, summed each one using a hyper method call, then took the product of those two sums with a reduction using <span class="inline-code">*</span>.
			</p>
			<div class="snippet">
my %changes = 'input-2-1.txt'.IO.lines.classify:<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;{ m/forward/ ?? 'horizontal' !! 'vertical' },<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;as =&gt; *.subst('up ', '-').subst(/[forward|down]\h/);<br/>
say [*] %changes.values».sum;
			</div>

			<h2> Part 2 </h2>
			<p>
				Part 2 changes the up/down instructions to refer to a sort of change in velocity or "aim" rather than a direct change in position.
				When moving forward, the depth is changed by this velocity multiplied by the amount of forward movement.
			</p>
			<p>
				This problem initially seems not to have a neat solution because it creates a dependency between the two types of movement, but using the power of zero, we can avoid a boring, iterative solution.
				I take the array of instructions and use it to construct two new arrays, one for the vertical "aims" over time and one for the forward motions.
			</p>
			<p>
				To get the aims array, I first replace and <span class="inline-code">forward</span> instructions with zeroes, since moving forward has no effect on the aim.
				Then I do a similar trick as in part one to massage up/down instructions into negative and positive numbers, repsectively.
				Finally, what we want is a running sum of the aim changes, so I use the triangular reduction metaoperator with <span class="inline-code">+</span>.
				A triangular reduction is simply a reduction that gives you back the intermediate values as well.
				The term "triangular" comes from how it would look if you wrote it out on paper, e.g.
			</p>
			<div class="snippet">
8 → 8<br/>
8 + 1 → 9<br/>
8 + 1 + 3 → 12<br/>
etc.
			</div>
			<p>
				An analagous strategy is used to construct a forward movement array using the fact that aim changes cause no forward motion.
				The final result is the sum of the forward motions times the sum of the two arrays zipped with multiplication, which is easily done with the <span class="inline-code">Z</span> metaoperator.

my @lines = 'input-2-1.txt'.IO.lines;<br/>
my @aims = [\+] @lines.map: *.subst(/forward \h \d+/, '0').subst('up ', '-').subst('down ');<br/>
my @moves = @lines.map: *.subst('forward ').subst(/[up|down] \h \d+/, '0');<br/>
say [*] @moves.sum, (@moves Z* @aims).sum;
